# andrew-ng-structuring-machine-learning-projects
My notes for [Andrew Ng's excellent course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-projects/home/welcome).

## Notebooks
The file [strucuring-machine-learning-projects-course-notebook](structuring-machine-learning-projects-course-notebook.ipynb) includes all my notes that I took while watching the lecture videos (along with screen-capping what I considered the most useful images / slides from his powerpoints).

There were no homeworks for this course.
